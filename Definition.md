Using an LLM (Large Language Model) to modify an application or product design based on feedback from a demo involves leveraging the advanced natural language processing capabilities of the model to analyze user feedback. This process typically includes parsing the feedback to extract key insights, suggestions, and issues raised by users. The LLM can then generate actionable recommendations for design improvements or adjustments. These recommendations are used by developers or designers to refine the application or product, enhancing its usability, functionality, or appeal based on real user interactions and experiences. This approach helps in creating a more user-centric product by integrating direct feedback into the development cycle through the use of sophisticated AI-driven analysis.
